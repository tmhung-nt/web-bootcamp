<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

  <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
  <li>175g of tahini</li>
  <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
  <li>Half a red pepper</li>
  <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
  <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
  <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
  <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.
If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>

<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> —
if you drink it, <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong>.</p>
