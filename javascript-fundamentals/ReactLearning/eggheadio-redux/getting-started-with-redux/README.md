Managing state in an application is critical, and is often done haphazardly. Redux provides a state container for JavaScript applications that will help your applications behave consistently.
Redux is an evolution of the ideas presented by Facebook's Flux, avoiding the complexity found in [Flux](https://egghead.io/articles/gentle-introduction-to-the-react-flux-architecture) by looking to how applications are built with the Elm language.
Redux is useful for React applications, but React is not a requirement!
In this series, we will learn the basics of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.
It's highly recommended that you have a quick read of the [Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html) alongside or before you watch the series.
